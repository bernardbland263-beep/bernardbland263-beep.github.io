There are moments when nothing is missing,
and yet nothing feels complete.

Not because something is wrong,
but because nothing is asking to be fixed.

Most of the time, we move as if silence is a problem.
As if stillness is an interruption.
As if a moment without direction must be filled.

But some moments do not want movement.
They want recognition.

This chapter is not an opening.
It does not begin anything.
It simply notices where you already are.

Perhaps you arrived here with time to spare.
Perhaps you did not.
Either way, the page does not adjust itself to you.

It stays.

If you feel the urge to continue, you may.
If you feel the urge to stop, that is also enough.

Nothing here requires momentum.
Nothing here keeps score.

This is not progress.
This is presence.
