*A book about stillness, isolation, and staying.*

This is not a project about productivity or urgency.  
Quiet Hours exists for slow reading, private reflection, and moments that do not ask to be optimized.

This space will unfold gradually.

You may begin with the foreword, or simply stay here for a moment.

## Read

- [Foreword — *Why Quiet Matters*](/foreword/)
- - [Chapter 1](/chapter-1/)
