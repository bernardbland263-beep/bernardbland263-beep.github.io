This is not a book about answers.  
It is not here to guide, to heal, or to explain anything away.

Quiet does not exist to fix us.  
It exists whether we are ready for it or not.

Most of the time, we treat silence as something temporary — a pause between obligations, a gap to be filled as soon as possible.  
We turn on noise instinctively, not because we enjoy it, but because stillness asks questions we are not prepared to answer.

This book was written in hours when nothing demanded attention.  
Hours when productivity had already failed.  
Hours when the world had slowed enough for thoughts to arrive without being summoned.

What you will find here is not a story in the traditional sense.  
There is no arc to follow, no lesson waiting at the end.

Each chapter is a space.  
A moment.  
A state of being that does not insist on progress.

You do not need to understand these pages.  
You only need to sit with them.

If you read this book quickly, it will resist you.  
If you read it slowly, it may not reward you either — but it will remain honest.

This book does not ask you to change.  
It only asks you to stay.
